	<title>Defining perturbations</title>

	<p>The user can create a perturbation and mark it on the grid. This
		perturbation can be a knockout (KO), an ectopic perturbation (E), or a
		range of allowed values ([min-max]) of a proper component. After
		creating the perturbation the user adds that perturbation to the
		active perturbations list and a color is assigned to that
		perturbation. If the user selects a perturbation from that list then
		that is the active perturbation.</p>

	<p>When drawing on the hexagons grid, either by clicking or
		dragging the mouse over the hexagons, those hexagons will have the
		active perturbation associated.</p>

	<p>If the user wants an hexagon to be associated with more than one
		perturbation than on the perturbations list he only has to select all
		the perturbations he wants to combine and then add them to the active
		perturbations list and a multiple perturbation is created (see Figure
		below ). At any time the user can delete a perturbation from both the
		perturbation and active perturbation lists.</p>

	<p>When drawing the perturbations the user can decide to mark all
		hexagons with the same perturbation, remove all perturbations, or use
		the rectangle fill button. The rectangle fill button when pressed
		turns yellow and at the hexagons grid all the hexagons inside the
		rectangle formed from the point where the mouse is pressed to the
		point where it is released will be marked with the active
		perturbation. This option remains active until the button is pressed
		and it is no longer yellow, or another tab is selected.</p>

	<p>
		If the user wants to save that perturbation set, then at the bottom of
		the tab the user must assign a name to that perturbation set and press
		the "+" button. This set is saved and can be later selected in the
		<link xref="simulation">
		simulation
		</link>
		tab. All saved sets are saved when the user decides to
		<link xref="save">
		"save"
		</link>
		the epithelium model.
	</p>

	<p>All the previously saved sets can be drawn on the hexagons grid,
		just by selecting then at the comb box at the bottom of the tab</p>
