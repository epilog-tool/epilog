	<title>Integration Functions Grammar</title>


	<p>
		The integration function specication follows a grammar designed for thispurpose, described as any combination of logical connectors representingdisjunction (|), conjunction (&amp;) or negation (!) of atoms of the following		form:
		
			<list>
		<item><p>G(t; m; M)</p></item>
		<item><p>G(t; m; M; d)</p></item>
		<item><p>G(t; m; M; d:D)</p></item>
	</list>Each atom is a proposition over the required value(s) of a componentacross the neighbours at specied distances of each cell. G is the component name, <em>t</em> is the threshold level of the component, m and M are, respectively, the minimum and maximum number of neighbours meeting the threshold requirement, and <em>d</em> (resp. D) is the minimum (resp. maximum) distance from the current position at which a cell is considered to be a neighbour. The distance parameters are optional; when they are not specied, only immediate neighbours (at distance 1) are considered. The D parameter is also optional, in which case only neighbours at ex-actly distance d are considered. If both d and D are specied, all cellsat a distance within the range are considered. Parameters m and M arespecied either by exact numbers or by the symbol (underscore charac-ter), which is replaced by the actual number of neighbours, consideringthe distance parameters. The t parameter may also be specied as "_",		which denotes the maximum level of the component.
