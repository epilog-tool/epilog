<title>Running a simulation</title>

<p>
	At the simulation tab (see Figure below ) the user can decide if there
	is
	<link xref="roll-over">
	roll-over
	</link>
	and if the simulation is to be made with a cellular automata, or a
	<link xref="composed-model">
	composed model
	</link>
	. Another definitions regarding the model are the choice of:
	<link xref="initial-conditions">
	initial conditions
	</link>
	, and the grid will display the initial state selected;
	<link xref="perturbations">
	perturbations</link>, and the perturbed hexagons have thicker edges; and the
	<link xref="priorities">
	priorities
	</link>
	.

<p>When choosing an input set, if there is a change in the type of
	input ( environment to integration, or vice-versa), the panel with the
	components is updated and only environment inputs are displayed.</p>

<p>By moving the mouse over the hexagons grid the value of all
	components and existing perturbations on a hexagon are displayed on the
	analytics panel, with a reference to the hexagon's coordinate.</p>

<p>
	To start the simulation just press the
	<link xref="step">

	</link>
or
<link xref="run">
run
</link>
button. All other tabs and selection panels are disabled at this time.
The iteration number is updated on top of the hexagons grid, and the
user can select or deselect components between iterations. During the
simulation the user can also save an image with the hexagons grid by
clicking on any point of the grid.
</p>

<p>During the simulation, pressing the "Save Initial State" button,
	will save the current grid as an initial state set, with the name set by the user.</p>

<p>The simulation keeps going until a stable state is found, however
	at any time the user can press "Restart" and reverts to where it was
	before the simulation began.</p>
